## System requirements
* Raspberry Pi Device
    * jumper cables, breadboard, resistors
* Raspbian OS
* Library (Wiring Pi, Pi4J)


## Features

* Clone project from Github
* Follow this RaspberryPi configuration tutorial
* Run `./gradlew build` in console to compile code
* Run `./gradlew bootrun` to run application


## Environment Setup

#### Software

- Java
- Spring Boot
- Spring Statemachine: https://projects.spring.io/spring-statemachine/
- PostGre SQL

#### Hardware
- Raspberry Pi

### Getting started with local development
Spring boot apps require a database in order to run. If you are a developer, and want to work on this application, you'll need to
setup a local database in order to run.
See also: application.properties.


###### Current Phase:
In Development

###### For Contribution Only Purposes:
- Only applicable to current members of the organization, git clone the project repository into a local directory.
- All work must be done on a unique branch that indicates the contributor and the feature.
- All merges from local branches can only be into the test branch. Approval from organization member is required prior to merging to master for publication
